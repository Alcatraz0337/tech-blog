# Run the blog locally, via nix

The site can be built and run locally using nix.
1) Make sure to have nix installed (see [nixos.org/nix][nix]) and then 
2) run `nix-shell default.nix` (or simply `nix-shell`) and you should have the blog 
3) running locally at http://localhost:4000.

Details about how to get jekyll to run locally via [nix], the instructions
how I set it up can be found on [this site][nixos-via-jekyll].
