Let's talk at first about libraries for creating universal applications. On Github you can find a large number of projects implementing the idea of universal web applications. However, all these projects have common drawbacks:

- missing functionality such as server side rendering (SSR) or i.e. hot reloading
- these are projects for quick start, not a library
- small number of project contributors
- projects were not updated when new versions of react.js were released

The first successful solution was the Next.js library, which, has 3600 contributors and over 33K “stars” on Github. To evaluate the benefits of this library, consider what kind of functionality you need to provide for the operation of a universal web application:

- Asynchronous data loading. In order for the results of asynchronous requests to be received prior to server rendering, Next.js implements a special type of the page component, which has an asynchronous static async getInitialProps ({req}) life cycle event.

- Server-side rendering (SSR).

- Passing server component state to client.

- Creating a component on the side of a web browser and linking it to an HTML document.

- Routing on the server and on the client should also be universal. That is, the same definition of routing should work for both server and client code.

- Code splitting. For each page, only the necessary JavaScript code should be loaded, not the entire application. When moving to the next page, the missing code should be reloaded - without reloading the same modules, and without unnecessary modules.

All these tasks are successfully solved by the Next.js library. This library is based on a very simple idea. It is proposed to introduce a new type of component - “page”, in which there is an async static method async getInitialProps ({req}). The “page” component is a normal React component. This type of component can be thought of as a new type in the series: “component”, “container”, “page”.

## Sample Project

Let's create a simple project with Next.js to demonstrate how it works. You will be surprised how little do we need in order to start actual application. Some complexity is hidden by the library and the rule convention over configuration is helping to keep code on our side really slim.

Create a new directory for our sample project `mkdir sample-app && cd sample-app`. Generate an empty npm project here with `npm init -y`. Then install Next.js together with React dependencies: `npm i next react react-dom --save`.

Now we just have to add a new npm run script to our `package.json`:

```js
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next"
  }
```

Let's try: `npm run dev`. Unfortunately you'll see an error message in your terminal. But with  next.js, error messages are usually pretty good and tell you exactly what you have to do next.

`Couldn't find a `pages` directory. Please create one under the project root`

So go ahead just create a `pages` directory and rerun `npm run dev`. It will tell you that it is now running on port 3000 - so just open localhost:3000 in your browser. It's rendering a 404 page however because we did not yet create any "page".

<img src="/img/posts/2019-01-04-nextjs/404.png" alt="404 Not Found" class="centered" />

So lets create an `index.js` file with the following content:

`export default () => <div>Hello World</div>`

If you refresh your browser you'll see our new awesome "Hello World" page. This sounds like very little but what actually happened under the hood could take you quite some time if you really do it from scratch:

- we got a free routing layer that is based on the convention that every path maps to a file in the pages folder (`/` is index.js, `/hello` is `hello.js`)
- our code is automatically transpiled - we can use `export` without any hassle
- we automatically can use react and `jsx` without any webpack setup
- if you change the text from `Hello World` to `Hello World!` it will automatically be refreshed in your browser
- ...


But lets focus on the "application" we want to build.

## Showing hotel data

We want to show data about an hotel. So let's create the necessary files for that:

For simplicities sake we will just use a static data file for the hotel data - src/hotel.js:
```
module.exports = {
    id: '1aa4c4ad-f9ea-3367-a163-8a3a6884d450',
    name: 'Dana Beach Resort',
    description: 'Das modern ausgestattete 5-Sterne-Hotel Dana Beach Resort liegt direkt am eigenen Sandstrand, erbaut in einem einzigartigen Stil, mit hohem Komfort, mit bestem Service und einem umfangreichen Sport- & Freizeitangebot.'
};
```

And we will use that file in our pages/index.js:
```
import hotel from '../src/hotel';

export default () => {
    return (<div>
        {hotel.name}
    </div>)
}
```

## Using another route and a button

What if we want to initially NOT show the data - we only want to reveal it after a click? Well that's easy and we could solve it by adding another page to show the hotel data and just link it form the index.js page:

pages/hotel.js
```
import hotel from '../src/hotel';

export default () => {
    return (<div>
        {hotel.name}
    </div>)
}
```

pages/index.js:

```
import hotel from '../src/hotel';
import Router from 'next/router'

export default () => {
    return (<div>
        <button onClick={() => Router.push('/hotel')}>Show Hotel</button>
    </div>)
}
```

Refresh your browser and click the button to go the /hotel page. Again this looks like very little - but there is a bunch of stuff we get for free.

- we see our routing in action now. And additionally to [links](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#with-link) we can also imperatively use Router.push
- if you open your webdeveloper toolbar you'll see that this uses client side navigation - there is no full reload of our application
- and again in the webdeveloper toolbar you'll see that we get "bundle splitting" for free: Each page has its own JavaScript bundle - resulting in awesomely fast pages.

Sure it is possible to achieve this with webpack or other bundlers manually as well - but with nextjs it is 0 effort.

## NOT using an additional page

But like in our last example application (TODO add link) our PO has a new requirement: we don't want to have a new url for displaying the hotel. We just want a button on the index page that reveals the content - without any url changes.

Well that is easy with react and state:

```
import React from 'react';
import hotel from '../src/hotel';

export default class extends React.Component {
    state = {
        showHotel: false
    }
    showHotel() {
        this.setState({ showHotel: true})
    }

    render() {
        if (this.state.showHotel) {
            return <div>{hotel.name}</div>
        }
        return (<div>
            <button onClick={() => this.showHotel()}>Show Hotel</button>
        </div>)
    }
}
```

But this has one downside: Regardless if the user really looked at the hotel data - he has to load it in his browser. And our PO doesn't like that because it slows down the page for ALL users when only 1% of them actually click on the "Show Hotel"-button.

We can use dynamic imports to fix that. Take a look at the webpack example app to see how we did it back then - and then we'll take a look at how easy it is with next:

## Dynamic Imports

Next comes with a default webpack configuration that will make dynamic imports just work (tm).
Lets rewrite our index.js to use a dynamic import.

```
import React from 'react';

export default class extends React.Component {
    state = {
        hotel: null
    }
    showHotel() {
        import('../src/hotel').then((hotel) => {
            this.setState({ hotel: hotel });
        });
    }

    render() {
        if (this.state.hotel) {
            return <div>{this.state.hotel.name}</div>
        }
        return (<div>
            <button onClick={() => this.showHotel()}>Show Hotel</button>
        </div>)
    }
}
```

Instead of a boolean state we will introduce an `hotel` state. When the user clicks on the button we dynamically import `src/hotel` - this will yield a promise and when that is fulfilled we can set the result to the state.
Again this looks easy - because it is and it should be - but just compare this to the effort we had without next...

## Improving our Dynamic Import

We can and should improve how our dynamic import works. It is awesome on fast connections. But how does it behave on slow connections? The user will click the "Show Hotel" button and nothing visual will happen for him - he has to sit and wait until the download is complete. Give it a try: open your webdeveloper toolbar and under the "network" tab throttle your network speed... It really sucks.

We can solve this by introducing some kind of loading state: When the user clicks on the button we do a `setState({ loading: true });` and show a spinner. When the code is loaded we do a `setState({ loading: false })` again to hide the spinner. But this is tedious - and next has something better:
`next/dynamic`.

First lets change our `src/hotel.js` file a bit to actually expose a react component:

```
const hotel = {
    id: '1aa4c4ad-f9ea-3367-a163-8a3a6884d450',
    name: 'Dana Beach Resort',
    description: 'Das modern ausgestattete 5-Sterne-Hotel Dana Beach Resort liegt direkt am eigenen Sandstrand, erbaut in einem einzigartigen Stil, mit hohem Komfort, mit bestem Service und einem umfangreichen Sport- & Freizeitangebot.'
};

export default () => {
    return <div>{hotel.name}</div>
}
```

And then we can use the awesome `next/dynamic`:

```
import React from 'react';
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const Hotel = dynamic(import('../src/hotel'));

export default class extends React.Component {
    state = {
        showHotel: false
    }

    render() {
        if (this.state.showHotel) {
            return <Hotel />
        }
        return (<div>
            <button onClick={() => this.setState({ showHotel: true })}>Show Hotel</button>
        </div>)
    }
}
```

Do you see what changed? I'm wrapping our dynamic import with `dynamic()`. This will create a react component that will dynamically import the needed code when actually try to render the component.
Sounds a bit weird at first. But `dynamic` has a second `options` param.

And just changig it from:
`const Hotel = dynamic(import('../src/hotel'));`

to

```
const Hotel = dynamic(import('../src/hotel'),
   {
     loading: () => <p>LOADING...</p>
   });
```

Will give us a "spinner" or loading screen for free. (Actually in newer react versions there is something comparable with React.Suspense - but that one only works on the client while next's also works with SSR).

## Wrapping up

Next.js is a powerful tool for building single page application. As it follows convention over configuration principle, it makes it look easy to do this. Projects build with Next.js mostly have the same or very similar structure. Obvious use case where you definitely have to consider using Next.js would be building prototypes. It will be also handy for teams who don't want to maintain their own webpack config and setups, but still have advantages that framework provides.
Next.js is by all means production ready and would fit for enterprise application and not only some small projects. It is built in a way that enables you to access lower level parts when needed, which makes it extremely flexible in what it does.
Not only is it really easy to use - it also has an amazing documentation. So far, every question we had was answered in their FAQ or through examples provided in their repository.
