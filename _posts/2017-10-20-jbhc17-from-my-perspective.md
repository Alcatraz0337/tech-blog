When I first heard about [JB][jbrains] coming to HolidayCheck to work with us I was excited.
I haven't heard much about him then, so I began googling him. I did remember the [7-26-talk]
(which is awesome, you need to check it out), but I didn't know much more.
Once I got to learn about him, I already knew - I can't miss this opportunity. And I didn't.

## The trip

As I am from Poland, I (actually me and my colleagues), had to hop on plane and get to Munich. Once there, we
went to the hotel, went out for a burger and a beer, got back, went to sleep. Morning came.
We arrived to meeting place around 9. JB was already there, preparing.
I approached him, shook his hand, exchanged few words. Seems like a nice guy - I thought.

## First day

I sat down in 2nd row, so that I would not miss a thing. Keynote began. I'll be frank. From the moment he started,
till the very end I listened to everything he had to say. Imagine his 7-26-talk, but for few hours (with breaks of course ;)).
It was all very interesting. JB has this skill to attract peoples attention and talk in a very interesting way.
Imagine a lesson you liked in school, because anything you heard there was valuable and attracted your attention.
It was the same.

The main reason I chose to go to [#jbhc17][jbhc17] was TDD and craftsmanship concerning our daily job.
But the majority of talks during the first day were not about that. I have to say, it got me worried a bit.
It was interesting, but still. Little did I know that JB had a plan.
He introduced a way of working in order to solve one problem: bottlenecks.
And he did a great job. We learned how to find what slows us down and how to tackle this.
He showed us how to work efficiently and what eventually matters - our clients, time to bringing features to them
is the most important thing. The shorter the better, as that is all that matters.

How?

He started off with [Winston W. Royce's waterfall][waterfall] model, then, step by step,
changed it into test first approach.
From queueing theory, test first programming to TDD and BDD. He spoke a lot about throughput of our work,
from raw material to final product. How it flows through the system, where the constraints lie.
JB described how value stream mapping works, which is the technique used to discovering bottlenecks.
You think you have a high efficiency in your team? 30-50%? Think again :)
We did the exercise and it was ~6%. Not kidding.

First day introduced a lot of very useful knowledge, and went by fast.
It ended with a very nice dinner at a pizza restaurant. We had a chance to talk about anything with JB.
You really need to meet this guy in person.

## Second day

At that day we split into two groups: programmers and product people.
First group had two exercises to choose from. I picked the one where we were supposed to build a cash
register. From very simple tasks (scan one product, show price) to advanced features.
The reason for this was to practice TDD approach (don't mistake it with TFP).
Why this? JB showed us a very simple diagram, a loop which is all about TDD: red - green - refactor.
As for the refactor part, JB mentioned two most important things to do, which refactoring boils down to:
 1. Removing duplication
 1. Improving names

It was a very nice experience. Step by step, when I was adding features, I saw how easy it was to add another one
if code I produced was left in a good shape. It involved removal of duplication, introducing abstraction, providing
better naming, etc. It felt great doing this.

After the exercise, JB continued talking about the cost of introducing TDD: it is an investment, but such
that pays of in long term (not that long!). As day went by JB told us also about few other, very interesting
facts and figures backing up test first approach.

This day ended with a really big surprise. **JBHC17 will happen again!** It will take place on 11-12 December.
I already know I will go. It's one of those things you can't miss.

## Final words

JB is a very nice person, he's very smart and he's a real professional.
During those two days I learned more about him, his personal life,
how passionate he is in what he is doing. One can say - but he's being paid for what he does.
Sure, we all are. But are we all giving everything we can to work as best as we can? He sure is.
And those two days have proven that. If I were to recommend a speaker to come and visit your company,
that sure as hell would be JB.

Thank you JB, for coming and see you next time.
Thank you, all of the organizers and HolidayCheck, for making it happen.
