As a company, HolidayCheck is very experienced in working remotely as we have several locations like Bottighofen (CH), Munich (DE), Poznan (PL) and Warsaw (PL). In addition, we already had good home office culture, allowing our colleagues to work from home frequently. As we consider “remote work as a skill”, we regularly train our employees doing “Remote Collaboration Trainings”.
 
Now that Covid-19, the Corona-Virus, forces us to officially stay in home office, we want to share our experience with you.
 
Here are our “Remote Cheat Sheets” with a couple of good practices to follow, to make remote collaboration and home office a success for you and your teams.
