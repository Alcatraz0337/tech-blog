Working in small iterations, being data-driven, user-input driven or simply lean is our ideal
style of working. And it is awesome when this works. But there are also other situations where
we have a big pile of work ahead of us that we need to sort out somehow. If it is a huge backlog
with ideas, some tasks that "just need to be done" or whatever the reason is that makes us
have lots of things on our plate (or in our backlog), we want to get them done efficiently.

In this post we will describe one way of how we started to prioritize our tasks.
Starting from actual metrics that we want to improve, we collected actions that we can do
and next we needed to figure out how to sort the actions to achieve an impact sooner.

## What's the problem?

Our exact case was the page speed. We are working on speeding up our website, which might have
a great impact, [as][impact-1] [many][impact-2] [numbers][impact-3] [show][impact-4].
The reason why to work on website speed is not questionable.
Next we need numbers, so we setup tools that help us steadily figure out our numbers, such
as TTFB (time to first byte) and TTI (time to interactive). We also measured the sizes of the 
downloads (JavaScript file sizes, CSS, images, ...) that happen in order to render our website.
We setup a continuous measuring for it, which reports numbers and shows our progress.
