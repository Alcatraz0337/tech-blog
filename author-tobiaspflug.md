# Tobias Pflug

I wrote my first lines of Basic code on an Amstrad CPC in the 80s. Later I learned Turbo Pascal and C and C++. For quite a while I was very much into lowlevel programming writing C and Assembler, so my first full-time job involved blaming the hardware department for faulty hardware until proven wrong with the oscilloscope (turned out the i2c signal was clean after all).

Several years later I sat in an office, about to solve yet another problem with yet another for loop. I had had enough of it. I ordered a Common Lisp book from amazon and started discovering Functional Programming. Fast forward to today and I'm still in love with Functional Programming. 

- I love Haskell and other strong statically typed PLs. 

- I am fascinated by Category Theory even though i still don't know that much about it

- I love Nix/NixOS because i've suffered enough from the problems Nix eliminates

- I love Jazz and especially John Coltrane

- I love my family because they matter more to me than any of these 1s and 0s ever could :)

- I am on [github](https://github.com/gilligan) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/tpflug)

- I organize BusConf, a FP themed open space conference: [BusConf](http://www.bus-conf.org)
