# Wolfram Kriesing

In 1997 I started to work in the IT industry. It has changed a lot since. I used to see specifications as
something settled and the base for what I implement. Nowadays I know that even specifications need people
to write them and that this can be fun. See [ECMAScript specification][ecma-spec], which is something that I am
following since 1999.

While trying to keep up with the latest technologies and practises, I also practice and love TDD,
incremental thinking and baby steps. I (co-)started and still run thinks like the 
[JSCodeRetreat], [JSCraftCamp], [ES6Katas], [TDDBin] and a meetup called [JavaScript the Language][jslang].

I started my carrier in the payment industry, freelanced a lot, and finally
co-founded a small JavaScript consultancy called [uxebu], which I helped run for 7 years.
In May 2017 I joined HolidayCheck, and I am trying to share experience and knowledge with
as many people inside and outside the company.
