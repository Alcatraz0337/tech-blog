# Radek Benkel

Learned HTML almost 20 years ago by changing stuff in the document and watching what has changed in the age, when Internet in Poland was billed by minutes. No CSS, only `<font>`, `<b>`, etc. And learning tables this way was... a demanding experience. 

Being rather full-stack enginner than front-end developer, I like to think of myself as a problem solver, and another "language is just a tool" guy. 

Interested in too many stuff. Big F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan.
